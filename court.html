        </div>
        <p>A Court of Thorns and Roses follows the adventures of a young huntress named Feyre as she journeys from her home to the faerie realm of Prythian. Feyre serves as the protagonist and narrator, providing insight into her private thoughts and heightened immediacy to the action. When the novel begins in the icy cold forest of Feyre’s bleak home world, she’s driven by her primary goal: caring for her family. As a child, she makes a deathbed promise to her mother to keep the family together and safe, and this vow forms the basis of Feyre’s daily life. When she kills the wolf on her hunt, Feyre shows that her word is the strongest currency she has. Though she considers the large, stealthy beast may be a faerie, the prejudices she holds about the fae based on a lifetime of myths and misconceptions make the animal’s death an even more attractive possibility. When Feyre launches the ash wood arrow, striking the wolf and bringing it down, the shot forever changes her life and acts as the inciting incident for the novel. </p>
